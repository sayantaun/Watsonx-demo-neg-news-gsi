He was ordered to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet after his release; must complete both drug and alcohol treatment, as well as sex offender treatment; and will be subject to random tests for drugs and alcohol, according to the district attorney's office and the court clerk.\n\nProsecutor Karen Hopwood, who had sought a longer prison term of 12 to 14 years, said the victim and her friends met Murphy on the Gerry School playground in Marblehead on the evening of June 12, 2009.\n\nThe girls, who were 14 at the time, asked Murphy to purchase alcohol for them, which he did, providing them with J\u00e9\u00a7germeister and Goldschl\u00e9\u00a7ger and then inviting them back to a home where he was housesitting.\n\nMurphy made drinks for the girls. The victim acknowledged on the stand that she had also taken some of her mother's Klonopin pills.\n\nShe became highly intoxicated from the combination.\n\nAfter the girls decided to leave to meet their friends at Marblehead's Crocker Park, Murphy, at the time eight years older than the teenagers, decided to join them.\n\nAt Crocker Park, Murphy raped the girl, an attack eventually interrupted by one of her friends and an older couple who had gone to the park after dinner.\n\nThe girl was only semiconscious and had been vomiting throughout the incident. She ended up being hospitalized in Boston as a result of the acute intoxication. A nurse found evidence of injuries consistent with a sexual assault.\n\nThe victim's mother, in an interview after the verdict, described her daughter as bookish and shy and said the incident has changed her.\n\nDefense lawyer Alex Cain had requested a shorter, four- to seven-year term for Murphy.\n\nCourts reporter Julie Manganis may be reached at 978-338-2521 or jmanganis@salemnews.com.\n\nTags\n\nUniqueid=sn5220173;\n\nTrending Video\n\nRecommended for you\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nCOUPON DEALS\n\nNEWSPAPER ADS\n\nGet your rewards\n\nHome delivery and Digital Access customers of The Salem News get deals for restaurants, hotels, attractions and other businesses, locally and across the country.\n\nTrending Recipes\n\nThe Salem News Podcasts\n\nCheck out our series of podcasts on topics from high school football to Halloween in Salem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Required\n\nTo play the media you will need to either update your browser to a recent version or update your Flash plugin.\n\nThis Week's Circulars\n\nSpecial Sections\n\nSenior Living\n\nBeverly Arts Fest 2023\n\nSummer Guide 2023\n\nObituaries\n\nSteve  Andreadakis\n\nNolan Christopher Kearney\n\nRichard \"Jeff\" Jeffrey Reilly\n\nJoh"], ["Daughter welcomes court's decision not to reduce rapist father's 18-year \njail term", "https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/daughter-welcomes-courts-decision-not-to-reduce-rapist-fathers-18-year-jail-term-1326018.html", "John Murphy (65), a former member of the Defence Forces, previously pleaded  guilty to numerous counts of rape, indecent and sexual assault...", "Jun 27, 2022", "\n\n\n\n\n\nIreland\n\nWorld\n\nEntertainment\n\nLifestyle\n\nSport\n\nBusiness\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData tracker\n\n\n\n\nLotto\n\n\n\n\nWeather\n\n\n\n\nDay At A Glance\n\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\n\nQuiz\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Report\n\n\n\n\nSponsored\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising Feature\n\nJobs\n\nProperty\n\nData tracker\n\nExplained\n\nClimate\n\nExtra time\nPen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaughter welcomes court's decision not to reduce rapist father\u2019s 18-year jail term\n\nireland\n\nShare this article\n\nPeter Doyle\n\nA child sexual abuse survivor who had encouraged other victims to \u201cstand tall and speak out\u201d today welcomed the decision by the Court of Appeal not to reduce the 18-year jail term handed down to her rapist father who began to sexually assault her when she was only three.\n\nIn June 2018, John Murphy (65), a former member of the Defence Forces, pleaded guilty to numerous counts of rape, indecent and sexual assault against his daughter Sophia at locations in Co Galway and Co Mayo on dates between 1988 and 2001 when she was aged between three and 15.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault against Ms Murphy, carried out in 2010.\n\nHe was sentenced to consecutive terms totalling 18 years for the offences by Mr Justice Michael White at the Central Criminal Court in July 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Justice White said the headline term for the offences, which he had described as \u201cdepraved\u201d, was life.\n\nMurphy, formerly of Nephin View Manor, Foxford, Co Mayo, had appealed the sentence on the grounds it was \u201cexcessive, disproportionate, and unfair in all the circumstances\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a judgment delivered today by Ms Justice Aileen Donnelly, Murphy\u2019s attempt to have his jail time reduced was rejected.\n\nSpeaking outside the Court of Appeal, Ms Murphy \u2013 who attended the hearing \u2013 said that she hoped the judgment would encourage other victims of sexual abuse to come forward.\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard my father was appealing his sentence, I was gutted. And to sit through the evidence again today made me feel sick,\u201d said Ms Murphy, who had waived her right to anonymity so her father could be named.\n\n\u201cSeeing my father again was also intimidating but I eventually managed to block him from my mind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was worried he would get the sentence reduced, and if that happened it would be as if no one had believed me,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cAll victims feel like that, and they don\u2019t think anyone will believe them. So, I hope this judgment encourages others to come forward in the belief that they will be listened to and believed.\u201d\n\nSister\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also said that her thoughts were with her sister Stephanie [Prendergast], who was another of her father\u2019s victims and who died from a brain haemorrhage last August.\n\n\u201cBut she also suffered from issues with her mental health as a result of the abuse she suffered,\u201d Ms Murphy added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was relieved and delighted with the judgment today, not just for her, or for me, but for all victims of this type of abuse.\u201d\n\nIn her judgment, Ms Justice Donnelly, sitting with Mr Justice George Birmingham, presiding, and Ms Justice Isobel Kennedy, said the abuse Ms Murphy suffered from her father represented the \u201cultimate breach of trust of a parent\u201d.\n\nShe said the aggravating factors in the case were the victim\u2019s age and the abuse of trust, and that the court could find \u201cno error in principle\u201d in the total sentence imposed by Mr Justice White.\n\nAs the judge read an excerpt from Ms Murphy\u2019s victim impact statement, Ms Justice Donnelly said Ms Murphy had \u201celoquently\u201d expressed the physical and psychological damage that the years of abuse had had on her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDad, you stripped me of every human right. My worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my confidence, my innocence, my childhood, my education, my teenage years, a normal life, even my own voice - until today,\u201d Ms Murphy had told her father as he sat in the dock awaiting sentence, Ms Justice Donnelly had observed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier, Brendan Grehan SC, for the appellant, said his client\u2019s \u201cessential complaint\u201d was that the sentence imposed was too long.\n\nMr Grehan said it was his submission that the sentencing judge \u201cdid not afford sufficient weight to the mitigation in this case\u201d such as admissions of guilt and an indication of an early plea to prosecutors during the investigation.\n\nA guilty plea was subsequently \u201centered at the earliest possible stage at the Central Criminal Court\u201d, counsel added.\n\nMr Grehan said his client\u2019s early plea was not only beneficial to the \u201coperation of the criminal justice system\u201d, which he described as being \u201cparticularly congested at this time\u201d, but was also of benefit to the victim in this case.\n\n\u201cThe proportionality principle, in my view, does not seem to have been at work in this case,\u201d he said.\n\n\"While I accept this was a serious case, and it called for a serious sentence, the sentence of 18 years in this particular case was excessive \u2013 and this court should act.\u201d\n\nPatrick Reynolds BL, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, told the court the sentence imposed had reflected \u201cthe seriousness and prolonged period of the offending\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to whether the learned sentencing judge took the concepts of proportionality and totality into account. In my respectful submission, he clearly did,\u201d he said.\n\nChildhood\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Murphy\u2019s arrest, Ms Murphy had given Garda Thomasina McHale a 110-page written statement outlining the details of her father\u2019s abuse.\n\nShe told Gda McHale that the abuse occurred initially at family homes in Co Galway, as well as later in Co Mayo. She was also sexually abused in the family car while on the way to visit her grandmother.\n\nIn her statement, Ms Murphy told garda\u00ed that throughout her childhood, there had been constant grabbing and touching. Her father \u2013 who was aged between 31 and 44 at the time of the offending \u2013 would grab her behind or breasts numerous times during the day.\n\nMs Murphy told garda\u00ed she could not explain how often the sexual abuse happened, she said it was horrendous and happened at every opportunity. She said that her father had all the control.\n\nShe said she had been sexually abused on Christmas Day, when a friend was in the house, and one time when her baby sister was present. She said Murphy even abused her wearing his army uniform.\n\nMurphy was arrested in October 2016 and interviewed by garda\u00ed. He admitted sexually abusing his daughter two or three times per week and raping her when she was about 13 or 14 years old.\n\nAt his sentencing hearing, it emerged Murphy had 73 previous convictions for the sexual assault of four victims and was serving an eight-year sentence for sexual abuse involving Ms Murphy's two younger sisters.\n\nVideo news\n\nVideo: Woman jailed for harassing former TD, fraud...\n\nRead More\n\nIn her victim impact statement, Ms Murphy said: \u201cAbusers control, manipulate you and make you feel like you are the one with the problem.\u201d\n\nAnd she urged victims to \u201cstand tall, speak out and take back your life, you are no"], ["Man jailed for eight years for sexual abuse and rape of younger brother", "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/criminal-court/man-jailed-for-eight-years-for-sexual-abuse-and-rape-of-younger-brother-1.4055261", "John Murphy 'cruelly violated' relationship with his brother in the family  home.", "Oct 18, 2019", "Home\n\nLatest\n\nSubscriber Only\n\nIrelandDublinEducationHousing & PlanningSocial AffairsStardust\n\nPoliticsOireachtas\n\nOpinionEditorialsAn Irish DiaryLettersCartoon\n\nBusinessEconomyFarming & FoodFinancial ServicesInnovationMarketsWorkCommercial Property\n\nWorldEuropeUKUSCanadaAustraliaAfricaAmericasAsia-PacificMiddle East\n\nSportGaelic GamesRugbySoccerGolfRacingAthleticsBoxingCyclingHockeyTennis\n\nYour MoneyPricewatchBudget 2023\n\nCrime & LawCourts\n\nPropertyResidentialCommercial PropertyInteriors\n\nFoodDrinkRecipesRestaurants\n\nHealthYour FamilyYour FitnessYour WellnessGet Running\n\nLife & StyleFashionFine Art & AntiquesGardeningPeopleTravel\n\nCultureArtBooksFilmMusicStageTV & Radio\n\nEnvironmentClimate Crisis\n\nTechnologyBig TechConsumer TechData & SecurityGaming\n\nScienceSpace\n\nMedia\n\nAbroad\n\nObituaries\n\nTransport\n\nMotorsCar Reviews\n\nListen\n\nPodcastsGUBUBorderlinesInside PoliticsIn the NewsThe Women's PodcastInside BusinessRoss O'Carroll-KellyAtlantic\n\nVideo\n\nPhotography\n\nHistoryCenturyBelfast Agreement\n\nTuarasc\u00e1il\n\nStudent Hub\n\nOffbeat\n\nCrosswords & PuzzlesCrosaireSimplexSudoku\n\nFamily Notices(Opens in new window)\n\nSponsoredAdvertising FeatureSpecial Reports\n\nSubscriber Rewards\n\nCompetitions\n\nWeather Forecast\n\n\n\nCourts\n\nMan jailed for eight years for sexual abuse and rape of younger brother\n\nJohn Murphy \u2018cruelly violated\u2019 relationship with his brother in the family home\n\nExpand\n\nJohn Murphy (45) formerly of Waterfall, Co Cork pleaded guilty last April to twelve sample counts including three of oral rape.\n\nDeclan Brennan\n\nFri Oct 18 2019 - 14:59\n\nA man has been jailed for eight years for the repeated sexual abuse and rape of his younger brother.\n\nOver the course of a decade John Murphy abused his brother who was aged between ten and 20 years old. The abuse took place in the family home in a town in Cork between 1988 and 1997.\n\nThe Central Criminal Court heard that the victim, now aged in his 40s, wished to waive his anonymity so that his abuser could be identified.\n\nMurphy (45) formerly of Waterfall, Co Cork pleaded guilty last April to twelve sample counts including three of oral rape.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nOn Friday, Mr Justice Michael White said Murphy used his younger brother for sexual gratification and that this had a devastating impact on the victim. He described the breach of trust as fundamental, saying the brotherly relationship was \"cruelly violated\".\n\nHe set a headline sentence of 13 years which he reduced to ten in consideration of the man\u2019s admissions to garda\u00ed\u00ad and subsequent guilty pleas.\n\nMr Justice White suspended the last two years on condition that Murphy engage with psychological services and victim focused work while in custody and stay under Probation Service supervision for that period.\n\nHe also ordered Murphy to undergo assessment for a sex offender treatment programme.\n\nReading his victim impact statement to court the victim said he had been on a long and horrendous journey.\n\n\u201cWhen John decided to do what he did to me, he imposed a life sentence on me,\u201d he said. He said Murphy took advantage of a child\u2019s innocence to satisfy his own sexual desire.\n\n\u201cI looked at him as a big brother and a hero. He looked at me as a sexual object. He became my biggest villain,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his brother groomed him and manipulated him and, as a result, the victim began to pull away from family and friends and became angry and violent in the family home.\n\n\u201cI was lashing out. I was screaming out for help in the wrong way. Every aspect of my life was falling apart,\u201d he said. He said he is now no longer a victim.\n\n\u201cI am a survivor. I am free of his disgusting and sick secret. I give back to John the shame, the loneliness, the resentment, the hatred that he gave to me over 30 years ago.

(Lloyd Fox/Baltimore Sun)\n\nThis week marks the 25th anniversary of the guilty verdict of John Merzbacher, a former schoolteacher convicted of the rape of Elizabeth Murphy in the 1970s, when she was a student at the Catholic Community Middle School in South Baltimore.\n\nA Baltimore City jury found the teacher guilty in 1994, after Ms. Murphy was an adult, of eight charges of rape and abuse. Following the guilty verdict, prosecutors dropped an additional 100 charges involving 13 other former students, who were prepared to go to trial against Merzbacher. Eventually, he was sentenced to four life sentences plus 10 years. He is now serving time in a Maryland prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI clearly remember the breaking news of the guilty verdict. The small TV on my kitchen countertop was turned on. I was tinkering in the kitchen, while my young daughter played at the table. A jury member commented on Liz\u2019s overwhelming testimony and the consideration of the facts presented to the jury. I was stunned by the news, knowing deep in my heart that there was still so much to tell about the terror inflicted by just that one person.\n\nPrior to teaching in the Catholic school, John Merzbacher taught in Baltimore City\u2019s public schools, where he sexually abused me and other students. (He has not been charged in those cases, and has always claimed that he\u2019s innocent, even after being convicted in Ms. Murphy\u2019s case). His actions in the public school were a precursor of what was to happen in the Catholic school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany years later, Liz and I decided to meet. Over coffee, we finished each other\u2019s sentences in describing our shared abuse experiences at the hands of John Merzbacher. To this day, Liz is faith-filled and kind, despite the atrocities inflicted upon her.\n\nUnfortunately, statistics show that most cases of child sexual abuse are not disclosed until the average age of 52 years. This lag in time speaks to the psychological toll of sexual abuse. Long after the physical threat ends, people like me struggle to find their voices and entrust others with information about their experiences. Current research from the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MCASA) reveals that in 2015, 24% of children in Maryland were sexually abused. That is nearly one in five children living in our own state. MCASA also reports that only 12-30% of child sexual abuse cases are reported to authorities.\n\nAll too often, perpetrators thrive in a culture of silence that they and those around them create to retain their power. This silence must be broken for sexual abuse to end. Here is what must be done:\n\n1. Educate children about sexual abuse. Provide age appropriate discussions so children learn about personal boundaries and know that it is OK to tell a trusted adult about their concerns.\n\n2. Monitor your child\u2019s social media activity. Online child pornography and the recording of abuse is a growing trend that overwhelms law enforcement agencies.\n\n3. Report suspected cases of child sexual abuse. Do not hesitate to call 911 or 410-361-2235 for Baltimore City Child Protective Services.\n\n4. Advocate for the complete elimination of the statute of limitations (SOL) for cases of past sexual abuse. SOLs do not guarantee justice, but they provide an important opportunity for victims to hold institutions responsible for past incidences sexual abuse.\n\nThis week\u2019s anniversary offers a unique bench mark for the many Baltimoreans who crossed paths with John Merzbacher. This includes direct victims, the students who witnessed his abuse, and all of those who knew him as a teacher and union worker. I am grateful to former Merzbacher students Liz Murphy and Linda Tiburzi, who continue to share their experiences so that others may find hope and reconciliation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor me, this week offers an opportunity to reflect on all that has happened in the past 25 years. The act of sexual abuse has come out of the closet. The social sciences have documented the potential long-term impact of childhood trauma and its societal costs. Laws have strengthened, and victim impact statements are part of the judicial "]]
